## Scrum Events

### Sprint Planning
The team will conduct a Sprint Planning meeting at the beginning of the sprint to define the sprint goal and select items from the product backlog to include in the sprint backlog. The Product Owner will present the backlog items, and the development team will estimate and commit to the tasks.

### Daily Scrum
A Daily Scrum meeting will be held every day for 15 minutes. Team members will discuss what they worked on, what they plan to work on next, and any challenges or blockers they are facing.

### Sprint Review
At the end of the sprint, the team will hold a Sprint Review meeting to demonstrate the completed features of the task management application to stakeholders. Feedback will be collected for future improvements.

### Sprint Retrospective
After the Sprint Review, the team will conduct a Sprint Retrospective to reflect on what went well, what did not go well, and how the team can improve processes in the next sprint.


## Scrum Artifacts

### Product Backlog
The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of all features and requirements for the Cloud-Based Task Management App. It is owned and managed by the Product Owner and continuously updated based on feedback and project needs.

### Sprint Backlog
The Sprint Backlog consists of selected items from the Product Backlog that the team commits to completing during the sprint. It also includes a plan for delivering these items within the sprint timeframe.

### Increment
The Increment represents the sum of all completed product backlog items at the end of the sprint. It is a potentially shippable version of the application that meets the Definition of Done.
